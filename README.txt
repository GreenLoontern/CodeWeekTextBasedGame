Welcome team to the promotional game we are supposed to create.
So: I created this GUI thing from an old project I worked on when I was beginning to learn to program.
It's pretty crappy, but it looks nice on the outside.

To edit:
The title of the game can be changed on line 16 in CodeWeekTextBasedGame.java
The inital message displayed can be changed on line 51 in CodeWeekTextBasedGame.java
The possible starting commands can be included in the switch statement
	beginning in line 113 in CodeWeekTextBasedGame.java. 
	We are going to need to make new classes for pretty much anything we do, considering
	how cluttered the main class is. They can be called from the switch statement.
	Ask me (Gabe) how; I know how to do it.

//Other stuff goes here\\

TA1.append() - displays stuff to the text area. DO NOT USE System.out.println()!
